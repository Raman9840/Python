This repository contains several Python scripts and a basic to-do list application. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose.
## Project Structure

## Files

### 1. calculator.py

Defines a simple calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows the user to select an operation, input two numbers, and display the result. Handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as division by zero.

### 2. control_structures.py

Contains a function to classify a number as positive, negative, or zero. Prompts the user to enter a number and uses if statements for classification. Uses a while loop to allow the user to classify additional numbers until they type "exit".

### 3. data_types.py

Demonstrates the use of primitive data types in Python. Creates variables of each primitive data type (int, float, str, bool), performs a few operations on them, and stores these variables in a dictionary.

### 4. todo_app

A basic to-do list application with the following modules:
- `main.py`: Handles user interaction with the app.
- `todo_operations.py`: Contains functions to add, delete, and view tasks.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions, like clearing the screen.
